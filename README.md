# The Game of Life

A cellular automaton simulator based on John Conway's [*Game of Life*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). This was done on JavaFX as part of our Automata Project.
The application can spawn several patterns on the grid such as:
- Beehive
- Blinker
- Glider
- Pentadecathlon
- Pulsar
- Exploder
- Explorer
